=== Error: "No binary for Chrome" while running npm run test
[sidebar]
testing, generator, setup

[example]
----
No binary for Chrome browser on your platform. Please, set "CHROME_BIN" env variable
----

If you face this issue while running npm run test on an app, you need to set up chrome environment on wsl ubuntu:

- open ubuntu/home/<username>/.bashrc
- add path to your chrome.exe e.g. CHROME_BIN='/mnt/c/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe'
- after restart of terminal echo $CHROME_BIN should not be empty

If you try to run tests again and face following issue you need to add a tmp folder.

[example]
----
Starting browser Chrome
Cannot start Chrome

Trying to start Chrome again (1/2)
Cannot start Chrome
----

add tmp folder e.g. with 
[example]
----
mkdir /mnt/c/tmp
